  <h1>Keith's Current Favorite Movies</h1>
  <h2>(Depends on Current Mood)</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>
  <p>The craziest crazy that ever crazied, but it's the multiverse movies that we didn't even know we needed after the
    Avengers!</p>
  <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Cut)</h3>
  <p>I count these three movies as one for the simple fact that they are a single story, filmed lovingly and
    simultaneously as a single project, and which <i>absolutely</i> stand the test of time!</p>
  <h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
  <p>I always have a soft spot for Pixar movies, but this one holds a special place in my heart because it was the first
    film my wife and I ever saw together as a couple.</p>
